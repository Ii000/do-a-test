Today is Tuesday.1111
It's May 28th.
It's my first time to use github.
I hava sign up for a long time, but I don't know how to use it.(yes...I was soooo lazy...)
(So I have to change!)

Yesterday, I went to the Google introductory sessions.
And I realized how important coding is to this world.
I want to live on a better life in the future.
First, I watched some lessons on the Internet.
